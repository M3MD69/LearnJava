 * <h1>Problem:</h1>
 * <h2>
 * The police department of your city has just started its journey. Initially, they donâ€™t have any manpower. So, they started hiring new recruits in groups.
 * <br/>
 * Meanwhile, crimes keeps occurring within the city. One member of the police force can investigate only one crime during his/her lifetime.
 * <br/>
 * If there is no police officer free (isn't busy with crime) during the occurrence of a crime, it will go untreated.
 * <br/>
 * Given the chronological order of crime occurrences and recruit hirings, find the number of crimes which will go untreated.

 * <h2>Lets consider the second example:</h2>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Firstly one person is hired.</li>
 *     <li>Then crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.</li>
 *     <li>One more person is hired.</li>
 *     <li>One more crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.</li>
 *     <li>Crime appears. There is no free policeman at the time, so this crime will go untreated.</li>
 *     <li>One more person is hired.</li>
 *     <li>One more person is hired.</li>
 *     <li>One more person is hired.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h2>The answer is one, as one crime (on step 5) will go untreated.</h2>
