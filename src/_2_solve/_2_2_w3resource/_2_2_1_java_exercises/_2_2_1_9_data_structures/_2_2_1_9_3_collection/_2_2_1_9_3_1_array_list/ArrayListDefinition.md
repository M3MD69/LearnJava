[//]: # (Notes)

# In Java, an ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface provided by the Java Collections Framework. It's part of the java.util package. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink in size as elements are added or removed. This makes it a more flexible data structure for handling collections of objects.
